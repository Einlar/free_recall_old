# Free Recall Web-App

Simple app to perform free recall experiments online, using [Redwood.js](https://redwoodjs.com/) as framework.

### Setup

Install Node.js v16, e.g. through Node Version Manager ([NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), see [this guide](https://heynode.com/tutorial/install-nodejs-locally-nvm/)).

Clone this repo and `cd` to it. Then install with:

```terminal
yarn install
```

You can run the app with:

```terminal
yarn redwood dev
```

Your browser should open automatically to `http://localhost:8910` to see the web app.

**TODO**: Add info on how to create the db
